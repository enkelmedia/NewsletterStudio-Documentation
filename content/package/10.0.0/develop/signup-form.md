# Signup form
The package ships with a simple signup form macro that is copied to your MacroPartials-folder. While this macro works the file acts as a starting point that you can use to build from.

When you create your own signup form it's very likely that you need to use the INewsletterStudioService to [add a recipient programmaticaly](../develop/front-end-api.md)
