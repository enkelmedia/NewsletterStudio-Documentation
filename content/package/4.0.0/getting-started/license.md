# Configure License
To use the full version of the package you need to purchase a license on this website. When buying the license you can provide your Workspace key to associate the license with a given Workspace - you can also leave the key-field empty and connect the licenses at a later stage.

## Automatic installation
Administrators can download and install the license via the backoffice. This will work both if you provided a Workspace key during the checkout or if you want to associate the current website with a license.

* Go to the "Email"-section and click the "Administration"-icon in the tree
* In the dashboard, expand the "Upgrade"-toolbar and use the "Connect and download license"-wizard.

## Manually installing the license

If you did configure the license during the checkout process, you need to download the `newsletterStudio.lic` file from this site. After this just place the file inside the `/umbraco/Licenses`-folder at the root of your project.

```
/umbraco/Licenses
```
