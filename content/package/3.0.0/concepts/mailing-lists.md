# Mailing Lists
The Mailing Lists are used to group [recipients](../concepts/recipients.md) into different lists. Each recipient can be connected to zero or more lists and the connection also as a `Status`, the status can be `Pending`, `Subscribed` or `Unsubscribed`. When using "Double Opt In" new recipients will have a `Pending` connection to the Mailing List until the subscription is confirmed.

## Importing recipients
In the `Actions`-menu in the top right corner you'll find the import-wizard that makes it easy to import recipients. You can either paste a comma or semicolon-separated list or recipients or upload a CSV-file.
