# Recipients
Each [Workspace](../concepts/workspaces.md) has it's own set of recipients. The Recipients-view shows all recipients in the workspace and allows for search and filtering.

## Recipient details
Clicking on a recipient in a list will show the recipient details-view, here we show a timeline of the interactions made by this recipient. Editors can also change information and manage subscriptions to [Mailing Lists](../concepts/mailing-lists.md).
